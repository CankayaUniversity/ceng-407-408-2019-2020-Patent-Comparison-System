This is a meta-package that pulls in the dependencies that are used by
`astropy`_ and some `affiliated packages`_ for testing. It can also be used for
testing packages that are not affiliated with the Astropy project.

* `pytest-astropy-header`_, a ``pytest`` plugin used for custom test header
* `pytest-remotedata`_, a ``pytest`` plugin used for controlling access to data
  files hosted online
* `pytest-doctestplus`_, a ``pytest`` plugin that provides advanced features
  for testing example code in documentation
* `pytest-openfiles`_, a ``pytest`` plugin for detecting file handles that were
  inadvertently left open at the end of unit tests
* `pytest-arraydiff`_, a ``pytest`` plugin that enables the generation and
  comparison of data arrays produced during unit tests
* `pytest-filter-subpackage`_, a ``pytest`` plugin that adds a ``-P`` option to
